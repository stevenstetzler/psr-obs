Our group at the University of Virginia (UVA) is observing and timing a set 10 pulsars using station 1 of the Long Wavelength Array. Each pulsar of interest has either not been timed before or has an extremely old timing solution published for it. 

Our group members are:

The list of pulsars and who is observing them is below:

- J0611+30: Megan Kenny, Yara Yousef, Raymundo Mora
- J1929+00: Shelby Laychak
- J2227+30: Liam Walters, Robin Leichtnam, Nick Clifford
- B1504-43: 
- B0950+08: Cole Latvis

Observational data for each of these pulsars is stored on the [LWA Pulsar Archive](https://lda10g.alliance.unm.edu/PulsarArchive/).

You can also find video recordings of our sessions with information and guided tutorials on using the LWA for pulsar observations and timing below.

Insert videos panel with link to videos like the cake thing in the sample. Same with coding tutorials.
